<a id="Summary" class="anchor" href="#Summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p> We will be developing a library of GPU-accelerated optimized matrix factorization routines in CUDA.</p>


<h2 style="color:white">
<a id="Background" class="anchor" href="#Background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p> The factorization routines focused on in this project are LU and QR (and, if time permits, Cholesky)
    decomposition. Both these function involve splitting a given matrix into a product of two matrices. </p>

<h4 style="color:white">
<a id="LU Decomposition" class="anchor" href="#LU" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LU Decomposition</h4>

<p> LU decomposition involves splitting a regular NxN matrix A into a product of a lower triangular matrix L
    and an upper triangular matrix U using Gaussian elimination. This factorization finds applications
    in simplifying linear algebra operations such solving a system of linear equations Ax = b, calculating
    the determinant of a matrix, inverting a matrix etc. </p>
    
<p> A sequential "right-looking" algorithm loops over columns and updates columns to its right based on
    the current column. The following pseudo-code describes the algorithm: </p>
    
 <code>
 <pre>
    for i=1 to N  /*loop over columns*/
      for j= i+1 to N
        A(j,i) = A(j,i)/A(i,i)  /*update L*/
        for k=i+1 to N  
          A(j,k) = A(j,k) - A(i,k)*A(j,i)  /*update U*/
        end
      end
    end  
  </pre>  
 </code>    
 
<h4 style="color:white">
<a id="QR Decomposition" class="anchor" href="#LU" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>QR Decomposition</h4>
 
 <p>
   QR factorization splits a rectangular MxN matrix A into two matrices Q and R such that A=QR. Here, Q is a 
   MxM orthogonal matrix whereas R is a NxN upper triangular matrix. This decomposition too is very useful in finding
   solutions to a system of linear equations. QR decomposition is also widely used to solve the linear as well as
   the nonlinear least squares problem.
 </p>
 
 <p>
   The algorithm to decompose a matrix into QR factors is based on the so called Givens rotations which are
   orthogonal. Using a sequence of givens rotations the given matrix can be transformed to an upper 
   triangular matrix. Givens rotations can be systematically applied to successive pairs of rows of matrix A
   to zero entire strict lower triangle. Parallelizing the computation of Givens rotations is one avenue but 
   there could also exist an opportunity to parallelize the step of applying this transformation to pairs of rows.

<h4 style="color:white">
<a id="LU Decomposition" class="anchor" href="#LU" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LU Decomposition</h4>

<p>
  The sequential algorithm for the LU decomposition will have to be modified in order to efficiently parallelize 
  it. The data dependencies in the algorithm in outermost loop will have to be dealt with. The algorithm in its
  current form, does not have independent outer loop iterations. Also, the 3 different loops within a matrix imply
  that there are different access patterns possible and an efficient implementation will use one which best exploits locality.
  The challenging part would be to implement a parallel version of the algorithm which best takes advantage of the
  locality in the problem and efficiently uses GPU resources such as shared memory. Thus, the problem should be an
  interesting opportunity to apply platform-specific and application-specific optimizations.
</p>

<h4 style="color:white">
<a id="QR Decomposition" class="anchor" href="#LU" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>QR Decomposition</h4>

<p>
  The challenge in this routine is to come up with an algorithm which reduces the amount of synchronization needed. 
  The idea is to exploit parallelism in as many steps of the algorithm as we can by efficiently implementing it on
  a GPU.
</p>

<h2 style="color:white">
<a id="Resources" class="anchor" href="#Resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h2>

<p>We will be using a GPU on one of the GHC machines. The references for the LU and QR decompositions are cited
   as [1] and [2] respectively.</p>

<h2 style="color:white">
<a id="Goals and Deliverables" class="anchor" href="#Goals-and-Deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h2>

<p>The goal of the project is to develop a fast library in CUDA to implement atleast two matrix factorization
   routines.</p>
<p>   
   We expect to deliver an efficient, highly optimized implementation of the two routines on an NVIDIA GPU.
   Moreover, if time permits, we would also extend our project to include a similar efficient implementation of 
   Cholesky decomposition. Matrix multiplication is another application we would like to implement as a part of the
   library. Though not a decomposition routine, we believe it would be a good challenge to implement a optimized 
   matrix multiplication routine as near in performance as possible to state-of-the-art implementations. The 
   performance of the library will be measured by plotting speedup graphs and comparing them with state-of-the-art
   libraries. Another extension is to provide a R interface to these optimized CUDA routines, which was the original
   inspiration behind the project - making R code faster by GPU acceleration.

<a id="Platform Choice" class="anchor" href="#Platform-Choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h2>

<p>GPUs are suitable for matrix operations since they offer a huge amount of data parallelism.</p>
